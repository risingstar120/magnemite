# Magnemite

![img](img/magnemite.gif)

A screen recorder for websites, built with Electron.

It's useful for getting repro steps from an end user, without needing them to explicitely tell you the steps.

Just package conifgure and package Magnemite, tell them to use it as they normally use your website, and now you have a video of the issue!
